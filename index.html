  <h2>Meow Man</h2>
  <p>When Han Bo-mi, who picked up a stray cat, woke up, she met Kim Chun-bae, the prince of Nyangguk who looks like a cat but has a human body, and decided to grant him three wishes. The first wish came true with a wish to wait a moment. The second wish was lottery win. It made sense and asked how the cat would win the lottery. Other requests for building owners, oil kings, and souls were cut off.</p><p>I made a second wish to make a handsome boyfriend, but I was none other than Kim Chun-bae himself!</p>
